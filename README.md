# Belly-button-Challenge-new-
pages link - https://32012178.github.io/Belly-button-Challenge-new-/

I had many issues in my original respository.
It wouldn't allow me to commit any of the commands listed below and I began to get increasingly frustrated so I created a new repository. I do apologise for the lack of consistency and hope the pages link works. 

I hope that all the code to build an interactive dashboard is there and the dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study). My results found that there were bacteria present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

all the required information is provided in this repository for you to explore the findings of the investigation. I attempted the extended exercise but had some issues in displaying it.


create a new repository on the command line
echo "# belly-button-challenge" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:32012178/belly-button-challenge.git
git push -u origin main
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin git@github.com:32012178/belly-button-challenge.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
